# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Trafalgar Log
Trafalgar Log is a Python Framework that standardize JSON Logs and make it easy to use. 
Its main goal is to abstract log implementation for tools that parse JSON data in log 
events, such as Splunk, Kibana, CloudWatch Logs, etc.
This framework was built on top of the packages [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) and [python-json-logger](https://pypi.org/project/python-json-logger/).

## üß¨ Log Structure
Below is a detailed section about each field printed when you use Trafalgar Log:

| Responsible | Field name         | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:-----------:|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      ‚úç      | **app**            | Represents the application name that generated the log event.                                                                                                                      |
|     üçï      | **flow**           | This field should be used as an identifier of who estimulated the application to start the execution which is being logged.                                                        |
|    üêª‚Äç‚ùÑ     | **code_line**      | Code line that the log event occurred; it will be printed as path/to/file.py - function_name:code_line.                                                                            |
|     üçï      | **correlation_id** | ID used to trace a single execution, end-to-end; this is an uuid4.                                                                                                                 |

|     üíª      | **log_code**       | A String that represents a general purpose of the log event; it can be used to represent all logs of database operations, for example.                                             |
|     üíª      | **log_message**    | The log message that you want to print.                                                                                                                                            |

|:------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   ‚úçÔ∏è   | You are responsible for configuring this field through environment variable (see section üåå Environment variables) |
| üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è  | This field is automatically filled in each log event.                                                              |
|   üíª   | When you code a log event, you will need to pass this field to log method (see section üë®‚Äçüíª Logging events üë©‚Äçüíª) |
|   üçï   | This field is optional, but makes your log easier to analyse (see section ü§î Optional fields)                      |


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### üåå Environment variables
For Trafalgar Log work in your application, you need to add these environment variables:
- **TRA_LOG_APP_NAME (mandatory):** this is the environment variable that 
  will be used as the **app** field in the log event.
- **TRA_LOG_DOMAIN (mandatory):** this is the environment variable that 
  will be used as the **domain** field in the log event.
- **TRA_LOG_HAKI (optional):** this will be used to set [the log level for the logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.setLevel); 
  the accepted values for this variable are as follows:
  - INFO
  - DEBUG
  - WARNING
  - ERROR
  - CRITICAL
  - NOTSET
  For more information, please visit [Logging Levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels).
- **TRA_LOG_SHAMBLES (optional):** if your application has sensitive 
  data being logged, you might want to list all fields that hold these 
  sensitive data and set this variable with them. For example, if your 
  application logs a brazilian document ID (CPF) and a log event have a 
  field called "CPF" and another field called "password", you can mask its 
  content by setting your environment variable like this: 
  TRA_LOG_SHAMBLES="cpf,password" (note that each field is comma separated).
  The log event will be printed like this:
  ```json
  {
    "app": "readme-docs",
    "flow": "writing documentation",
    "code_line": "main.py - <module>:29",
    "correlation_id": "552f5139-5da9-4e89-8c1b-9d2a81f9461c",
    "date_time": "2022-09-18 19:25:43.749",
    "domain": "victoraugustofd",
    "instance_id": "347f2d8d-0bde-485e-a120-513e972a3cee",
    "log_code": "Database",
    "log_message": "Getting contributor data from database.",
    "payload": {
      "cpf": "*",
      "password": "*",
      "contributor_name": "Trafalgar Law"
    },
    "severity": "INFO",
    "timestamp": 1663539943749
  }
  ```
  Trafalgar Log already has some fields that are always shambled, such as 
  "password", "senha" and "contrase√±a".

### üë®‚Äçüíª Logging events üë©‚Äçüíª

Here are some examples of all types os logs that Trafalgar Log can print 
(this is just a code snippet only to exemplify how to use this package):

```python
from trafalgar_log.core.logger import Logger
from docs.out.adapters import DatabaseAdapter
from docs.core.exceptions import DocsBusinessError
from typing import Optional

database_port = DatabaseAdapter()


def get_contributor_data(contributor_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
  try:
    Logger.info(log_code="Database",
                log_message="Getting contributor data from database.",
                payload=f"Contributor id: {contributor_id}")
    contributor_data = database_port.get_contributor_data(contributor_id)

    # It is optional to name the arguments, since the order log_code, 
    # log_message and paylod are respected.
    Logger.info("Database", "Contributor found on database.", contributor_data)

    if contributor_data.get("test_field"):
      Logger.debug("Database", "Debugging method.", contributor_data.get("test_field"))

    if contributor_data.get("status") != "ACTIVE":
      Logger.warn("Database", "Contributor not active.", contributor_data.get("status"))

    return contributor_data
  except DocsBusinessError as business_error:
    Logger.error("Database", f"Error getting contributor data: {str(business_error)}", f"Contributor id: {contributor_id}")
  except Exception as exception:
    Logger.critical("Database", f"Exception getting contributor data: {str(exception)}", f"Contributor id: {contributor_id}")
  finally:
    return None
```

### ü§î Optional fields
The three optional fields below should be set at the beginning of the 
process, so all subsequent log events share the same data.

- **correlation_id**: this field should be filled with an already 
  predefined correlation_id that someone passed to the application.
  If this is not set at the beginning of the execution, Trafalgar Log will 
  generate one with the method uuid.uuid4().
  
  **Implementation**:
  ```python
  from trafalgar_log.core.logger import Logger

  Logger.set_correlation_id("put here the correlation_id received or create one")
  ```
- **flow:** if not set, Trafalgar Log will set this field as NOT_SET.

  **Implementation**:
  ```python
  from trafalgar_log.core.logger import Logger

  Logger.set_flow("put here the desired flow")
  ```
- **instance_id:** if not set, Trafalgar Log will set this field as NOT_SET.

  **Implementation**:
  ```python
  from trafalgar_log.core.logger import Logger

  Logger.set_instance_id("put here the desired instance_id")
  ```

### ‚ùó Exception logging
Every time that you want to log an exception, you should use the method 
Logger.error() or Logger.critical() for two reasons:
1. Best practices;
2. Trafalgar Log is prepared to capture the stacktrace of the exception with 
   this two methods and print as an array of strings, as in the example below:
  ```json
  {
    "app": "readme-docs",
    "flow": "writing documentation",
    "code_line": "main.py - <module>:34",
    "correlation_id": "545723a8-1ed8-4886-80d6-9fdb7250351e",
    "date_time": "2022-09-20 23:03:15.976",
    "domain": "victoraugustofd",
    "instance_id": "417f06d6-06ce-47a6-9151-86afb93c3265",
    "log_code": "Generating exception",
    "log_message": "Trying to get an invalid key from a dict.",
    "payload": "",
    "severity": "ERROR",
    "timestamp": 1663725795976,
    "stacktrace": [
        "Traceback (most recent call last):",
        "  File \"D:\\Documents\\Victor\\Git\\GitHub\\victoraugustofd\\trafalgar-log\\main.py\", line 32, in <module>",
        "    os.environ[\"a\"]",
        "  File \"D:\\Program Files\\Python\\lib\\os.py\", line 679, in __getitem__",
        "    raise KeyError(key) from None",
        "KeyError: 'a'"
    ]
  }
  ```
